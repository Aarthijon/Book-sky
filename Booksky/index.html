            <h2>The Giver</h2>
            <h5>Lois Lowry</h5>
            <p>The Giver is a 1993 American young adult dystopian novel written by Lois Lowry.In an effort to preserve
                order, the society also lacks any color, climate, terrain, and a true sense of equality. The protagonist
                of the story, a 12-year-old boy named Jonas, is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory,
                the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness. Jonas struggles with concepts of the
                new emotions and things introduced to him, and whether they are inherently good, evil, or in between,
                and whether it is possible to have one without the other.</p>
